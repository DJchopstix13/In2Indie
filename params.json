This application will serve as a way for these producers/ developers to not only advertise their product, but also reward them some money for any of their products sold on this application. The Indie producer/ developers can upload their product online to a remote server, which will be turned into a viewable product on In2Indie. Other users (the community) can view a certain product a limited amount of time on this application and download and purchase that product.\r\n\r\nTo access In2Indie:\r\n-------------------\r\n\r\n###Via web browser: \r\n    98.158.149.241  //URL Domain name TBD\r\n\r\n###For Developers:\r\nI assume you have the following installed:\r\n    Node.js\r\n    NPM\r\n    \r\nIf not, please refer to [NodeJS Github README](https://github.com/joyent/node) or [Isaac's Gist on installing node and NPM](https://gist.github.com/isaacs/579814)\r\n\r\n####To Install and run:\r\n\r\n    npm install    //installs the node modules \r\n    node app.js    //runs In2Indie's web application\r\n\r\n####To Create Database AND load sample data\r\n\r\n*NOTE*I am assuming you have a PostgreSQL Database named `postgres` running on your machine.\r\n\r\nFirst, you must delete/create the PostgreSQL Database and then load sample data.
