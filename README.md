Welcome to In2Indie
==================
By: Jonathan Piatos

In2Indie is a CMSI402: Senior Project Laboratory Project. 

Overview:
------------
In2Indie is a web- application that hosts Indie- genre products that include (but are not limited to) video games, music, and movies. This application will serve as a way for these producers/ developers to not only advertise their product, but also reward them some money for any of their products sold on this application. The Indie producer/ developers can upload their product online to a remote server, which will be turned into a viewable product on In2Indie. Other users (the community) can view a certain product a limited amount of time on this application and download and purchase that product.
